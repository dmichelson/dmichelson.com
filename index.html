<p> Welcome to my web home! I am currently a resident physician in internal medicine and a member of the Stanbury Physician-Scientist Pathway at Massachusetts General Hospital.
I earned my MD in the Program in Health Sciences and Technology at Harvard/MIT and my PhD in immunology in the lab of Diane Mathis and Christophe Benoist at Harvard. 
During my PhD, I studied the mechanisms that produce immunological self-tolerance in T cells, and how breakdown of these mechanisms can lead to autoimmunity.
Previously, I worked in the lab of David Schatz at Yale, studying the molecular mechanisms that B cells use to generate high-affinity antibodies.
Broadly speaking, I'm interested in the intersection of immunology, genomics and medicine, especially as they relate to immune-mediated diseases. </p>
